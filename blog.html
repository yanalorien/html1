    <h3>Feeling So Much Healthier And Energetic</h3>
    <p>

        August 2018 vs Christmas 2019 Feeling so much healthier and energetic Started with strict keto back in January 2017, lost many inches and lbs but quickly gained most of it back by the end of the year, so I decided just to do very low carb. Staying away from pasta, bread, rice and sugars. Also, I drink tons of water and my job keeps me busy moving so all in all it’s helped to achieve my current weight and keep it off. I did enjoy too much of my mother in laws fudge at Christmas dinner, along with all the trimmings!! Lol but, I didn’t let it discourage me and now I’m back on track. Don’t give up and don’t get discouraged!!

        I feel great. I have more energy, migraines gone, joint inflammation gone, less tired, and lethargic. Keto is more than a diet for me, it has become my lifestyle. 30 lbs down. I'm not where I want to be yet but this is a good start. Thank God. Keto on, folks! It works. :)
