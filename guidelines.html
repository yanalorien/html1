<h2>Healthy Keto Diet Guidelines</h2>
<p>
    When you keep in mind that food is intended to provide nourishment not only calories, there are two principles that form the foundation of a healthy ketogenic diet:
</p>
<p>
    * Eat low carb, high-fat foods that cause you to use your own fat reserves when you're in ketosis.
</p>
<p>
    * Eat foods that provide all the nutrients your body requires for health.
</p>

<h2>Don’t Eat Sugar at All</h2>
<p>
    To get into ketosis and stay there, stay away from any type of sugar or anything that turns quickly into sugar such as wheat, corn, rice, cereal, most fruits, and the like.
</p>
<p>
    When you consume sugar, your body will burn it as fuel, and you won’t experience the healthy, weight-loss benefits of fat burning.
</p>
<p>
    You’ll need to be alert to the ingredients of all foods and beverages you consume. Be sure to check nutrition labels for sugars or sugar-creating ingredients.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Examples of these include:</strong>
</p>
<u><i> Table sugar, Fructose, Honey, Brown sugar, Agave nectar, Dextrose, Maltodextrin, High-fructose corn syrup, Maple syrup, Rice syrup, Juice, Alcohol </i></u>
