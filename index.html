<h2>What is a ketogenic Diet?</h2>
<p>
    A ketogenic diet is simply a diet, which causes your body to run on what are called ketones instead of sugar from carbohydrates like pasta, grains or sugary foods. Ketones are a type of acid formed when your body begins burning stored or dietary fat for fuel instead of carbs. Theyâ€™re actually a very efficient fuel for your body. The most abundant, and beneficial, ketone is called beta-hydroxybutyrate or BHB.
</p>
<p>
    On a typical American diet, your body is constantly converting sugar from carbs into energy. However, when you change to a high-fat diet and limit your net carbs, your body starts producing ketones for energy. As a result, on a low carb diet, your body automatically begins burning fat.
</p>
<p>
    In a keto diet, the goal is <strong>to switch</strong> your body from burning sugar fuel <strong>to fat fuel</strong>.
