<h2>What is a ketogenic Diet?</h2>
<p>
    A ketogenic diet is simply a diet, which causes your body to run on what are called ketones instead of sugar from
    carbohydrates like pasta, grains or sugary foods. Ketones are a type of acid formed when your body begins burning
    stored or dietary fat for fuel instead of carbs. They’re actually a very efficient fuel for your body. The most
    abundant, and beneficial, ketone is called beta-hydroxybutyrate or BHB.
</p>
<p>
    On a typical American diet, your body is constantly converting sugar from carbs into energy. However, when you
    change to a high-fat diet and limit your net carbs, your body starts producing ketones for energy. As a result, on a
    low carb diet, your body automatically begins burning fat.
</p>
<p>
    In a keto diet, the goal is <strong>to switch</strong> your body from burning sugar fuel <strong>to fat
    fuel</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Do You Really Need Carbs?</h2>
<p>
    The dictionary defines carbohydrates as <s>“substances such as sugar or starch that provide the body with energy”</s>.
</p>
<p>
    Simple carbohydrate made of refined flour and added sugar rapidly converts to blood sugar (glucose) when you eat
    them. Complex carbohydrates, such as grains and beans, convert more slowly. Regardless, all carbohydrates convert to
    sugar in the body - and when your net carb intake is high you'll gain weight.
</p>
<p>
    All your life you've been told that you need carbohydrates for energy or that your brain can only run on glucose
    made from carbs, a type of sugar. Those are <strong>myths</strong>, as evidenced by the countless healthy, happy individuals on
    low-sugar or low-carbohydrate diets. Instead, you can run your body on other fuel sources such as fatty acids and
    ketones produced by fat burning. While your body does need a very tiny amount of glucose (sugar) to function, it has
    the capability to produce all the glucose it needs internally from fat or protein, not carbs.
</p>
<p>
    <u>The carbs you do need are vegetables</u>—but only for the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber they supply.
    Otherwise, your body does not require carbohydrates for good health. In fact, the opposite is true. Carbohydrates,
    particularly refined carbohydrates, deplete your nutrients and negatively affect your health. Carbs also turn to fat
    in your body, and they impede fat burning. (That's why you haven't been able to lose weight on a high-carb diet)
</p>

<h2>Ketosis Simplified</h2>
<p>
“Ketosis” is the state your body is in when it is converting fat into energy. When a diet is referred to as <strong>ketogenic”</strong>“,
it only uses a particular combination of foods that puts your body into ketosis using a process called ketogenesis. This
food combination is:

</p>
<p>
The goal of the ketogenic diet is to get your body into ketosis and keep it there. When you're in ketosis, your body
creates better fuel for itself and for your brain.
</p>
<p>
As you can guess, the foods that throw you out of ketosis are excessive carbs and sugar and high protein. So too will
frequent eating.
</p>
<p>
Getting your body into ketosis is like flipping a switch from using energy from carbs to using energy from fat. The
result is that you start burning fat automatically as you go through your day.
