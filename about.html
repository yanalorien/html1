    <h2>Our Personal Story</h2>

    <p>
    Dramatic transformation with my own health fueled me to start studying nutrition with a passion. I quit my full-time chiropractic work and was driven to study everything I could get my hands on in the fields of food therapy, endocrinology, autonomic nervous system physiology, Chinese medicine, nutrition, alternative techniques, acupressure, and exercise physiology.
    </p>
    <p>
    I was either constantly watching nutritional videos on VHS at night or studying in the early morning.
    </p>
    <p>
    I had a large group of patients who I could test things on, and I started to learn what worked and what didn’t. The results got better and better. Eventually, I started teaching my methods to other medical professionals and even taught at Howard University as an associate professor.
    </p>
    <p>
    This went on for about 29 years.

    Over time, my passion grew and I became a guru in the field of healthy eating, nutrition, and weight loss. I wrote a book on my findings and published The 7 Principles of Fat Burning. But the journey didn’t end there, and I kept learning new things with the help of my large group of clients. Around 2012, I realized that there were a few key things I had wrong. In my original book, I recommended fruit (especially apples) to snack on throughout the day.

    Ultimately, the principles of intermittent fasting and Healthy Keto turned things completely around for me. I updated my book to The Healthy Keto Plan and started my YouTube channel, where I currently share my knowledge on these healthy ways of eating.

    Ever since, my mission has been to extract from the sea of confusing and complex information the simple, powerful truths about health. My purpose is to be The Knowledge Doc, helping people understand health in a simple way.
